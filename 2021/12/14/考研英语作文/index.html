<p>Dear editors,</p>
<p>Many college students have no concept of  $\color{red}{\text{frugal}}$  in their mind. They take it for granted that they spend money from their parents before they enter into society.</p>
<p>This  $\color{green}{\text{extravagant}}$  spending is primarily caused by the following factors. First of all,nowadays most of the students are the only children of their families. They are  $\color{green}{\text{the apple in their family’s eyes}}$  and naturally get more care and pocket money. In addition,with the improvement of living standards, parents can afford higher expenditure of their children.</p>
<p>From my point of view, a college student, as a pure consumer, should learn to be  $\color{red}{\text{economical}}$ .We should limit our expenditure on daily necessities and not buy whatever we want regardless of their prices. The habit of  $\color{red}{\text{provident}}$  can help us form right values and is favorable to ourfuture development.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br>Li Ming</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Shakespeare,</p>
<p>Words fail to express my  $\color{green}{\text{heartfelt gratitude}}$ . I am  $\color{green}{\text{referring to}}$  that unfortunate accident the other day, when I was knocked off my bike by a taxi.</p>
<p>If it had not been for your timely assistance in  $\color{green}{\text{giving me first aid}}$ , I reckon that the consequences might have been very serious. Everyone agrees that it is your quick-witted response in that emergency that has  $\color{green}{\text{led to}}$  this satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>Although nowadays people in  $\color{red}{\text{mounting}}$  numbers talk about the need to be unselfish, we see very few people practice what they  $\color{red}{\text{preach}}$ . If there were more people like you, this worldwould be a much nicer place.</p>

Indeed, I  $\color{green}{\text{particularly}}$  like the way you demonstrate complex issues with the use of simple drawings. This makes your lessons both interesting and memorable. However, I do feel that you could provide us with more  $\color{green}{\text{handouts}}$ , as I don’t often have enough time to take down all the  $\color{green}{\text{prominent}}$  points.l would also like to see more discussion work, since I find this method the most suitable way to clarify and deepen my understanding of the subject content.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank you for the interest you are taking in your students and look forward to your next lecture.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>I am writing the email to introduce one of the most  $\color{green}{\text{prestigious}}$  Chinese celebrities to you, Confucius.</p>
<p>Being a great thinker, educator and founder of Confucianism, Confucius is an ancient sage during the  $\color{red}{\text{Spring and Autumn Period}}$ . His words and life story were recorded by his  $\color{red}{\text{disciples}}$  and their students in  $\color{red}{\text{The Analects}}$ . As an enduring classic of ancient Chinese culture, The Analects has influenced all thinkers, writers and politicians in the  $\color{red}{\text{over-2000-year-long}}$  history of China after Confucius. No scholar could truly understand this long-standing culture or the inner world of the ancient Chinese without this book.</p>
<p>Much of Confucian thought on Heaven and people represents universal human values.This is perhaps why Confucian thought in the 21$^{st}$ century still remains the interest of not only the Chinese people but also in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br>Li Ming</p>

<p>Most people today are aware of the environmental challenges facing our planet. Young people understand that cutting down on energy use and decreasing waste are necessary steps towards  $\color{green}{\text{curbing}}$  climate change and preventing energy shortages. As is shown in the cartoon, two people in suits are walking proudly from a dinner table which is full of all kinds of  $\color{green}{\text{leftovers}}$  such as chicken, pork, fish,  $\color{red}{\text{lobster}}$ , and so on. The caption reads that “RMB 200 billion are wasted every year”.</p>
<p>For  $\color{green}{\text{environmentally-conscious}}$  students seeking to make a positive difference on their own college campuses, the simplest and best approach is to follow the three R’s: reduce,reuse and recycle. The first”R”stands for “reduce”. Students can reduce waste and limit their energy usage on campus in many ways. For instance, electricity usage can be limited by turning off computers before going to sleep and remembering to turn off the lights before leaving a room. The second of the three R’s is”reuse”. Many products commonly used on college campuses, such as spoons and chopsticks, are available in both single-use and reusable forms. Whenever possible,students should choose reusable products over  $\color{green}{\text{disposable}}$  ones.The third”R”stands for “recycle”. With recycling bins placed in various locations across many campuses, it is easier than ever before for students to recycle.</p>
<p>High waste levels contribute to energy  $\color{red}{\text{depletion}}$  and environmental  $\color{red}{\text{degradation}}$ . We should all do our part to respond to the environmental challenges that we face on this planet. For college students, following the three R’s is a simple but effective way to cut downon waste and help to make the world a greener place.</p>

<p>The ancient culture of China is one of the great treasures of human civilization. In the photo above, a foreign lady is pleasantly appreciating a traditional Chinese vase in a museum. $\color{green}{\text{Obviously}}$ , she has been attracted by its elegant charm.</p>
<p>In my opinion, traditional Chinese culture is not only certain to survive, but is, in fact,destined to  $\color{green}{\text{thrive}}$  and  $\color{green}{\text{prosper}}$ . One factor that has already begun to contribute to the preservation of Chinese traditional culture is its commercialization.Another reason that the future of China’s ancient culture can be considered “safe” is the active efforts to protect it  on the part of the Chinese government. Finally, the culture of China is supported by widespread and growing international interest in China and its traditions.</p>
<p>For China, as for any other rapidly developing country, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadow of modernization. If tai chi, kungfu or Peking opera ever  $\color{red}{\text{perished}}$  from the earth, it would be a tragedy of immeasurable proportions. Fortunately, as a result of successful commercialization efforts,  $\color{green}{\text{unwavering}}$  government support and growing interest overseas, the future of China’s traditional culture seems brighter and more secure than ever before.</p>

It is shown in the drawing that a lovely young boy is sitting at a desk. Reading an interesting book on the desk, he is totally absorbed in what he is doing and concentrating on his reading. We are informed that,Reading makes a full man."

Nowadays few of us read extensively after we leave school. This tendency is rather disturbing, for reading extensively is no less necessary to one's mental life than fresh air is to one's physical life. From reading extensively, we can derive companionship, experienceand instruction.First and foremost, a good book is our faithful friend. It can increase our contentment when we are cheerful and happy, and lessen our pain when we are sad or lonely. Furthermore, reading extensively can also offer us a wide range of experiences. In reading, we may join tourists marveling at incredible power of Niagara Falls,mingle with the happy throngs strolling in the Paris boulevards and experience the bitterness or joy of peoplein different lands and in different times. Few of us can travel far from home or live longover one hundred, but all of us can live many lives through the pages of books. Last butnot least, reading extensively can increase our intellectual ability, broaden our minds and make us wise.

Though with the advent of TV, mobile phones and the Internet, books are no longer readas extensively as they once were, nothing can replace the role that reading plays in our lives.

If given the choice, a great many people would change at least one part of theirappearance. As is depicted in the drawing, a young lady is requesting a doctor to give her astraighter nose, bigger lips, and bigger eyes. These changes fall into the category of plasticsurgery—the branch of surgery dealing with therapeutic or cosmetic reformation of body parts-which has gained tremendous popularity in recent decades.

<p>As is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon, a doctor, wearing a white gown and a stethoscope, is holding a medical record and speaking to his patient in a hospital ward.Apparently,  $\color{green}{\text{the intended meaning of}}$  the drawing is that people are doing less and less exercises now, which is not good news for their health.</p>
<p>There are numerous ways of keeping fit. First and foremost, it is most effective to do physical exercises. People variously choose jogging, playing basketball, swimming, skating,climbing or riding as their regular exercises, because exercise never fails to make us stronger and more energetic. Moreover, we should  $\color{green}{\text{put great emphasis on}}$  forming good habits. A balanced diet and sufficient sleep are both  $\color{green}{\text{indispensable}}$  to physical fitness. What’s more,mental health should also be taken seriously. Especially in adversity, we need to maintain an optimistic mentality to  $\color{green}{\text{pull through}}$  life’s pains and sorrows, twists and turns.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, I have a  $\color{green}{\text{peculiar}}$  interest in yoga as a form of exercise. An hour’s exercise every day usually makes me feel healthier and more  $\color{green}{\text{vigorous}}$ . Besides I never touch cigarettes or wine, nor do I stay up late.Instead, I keep a balanced diet and go to bed before 11 o’clock at night, because I believe burning the midnight oil is harmful to health.More importantly, an optimistic attitude toward life makes me confident and persistent.To sum up, all these practices guarantee a healthy body and a happy life.</p>

<p>$\color{green}{\text{Plagiarizing}}$  the work of others and cheating on exams are two unfair  $\color{green}{\text{tactics}}$  used by students in an attempt to attain higher grades.

<p>Plagiarism and cheating are wrong because they  $\color{green}{\text{adversely}}$  affect other students, the university, and even the  $\color{green}{\text{perpetrators}}$  themselves. Firstly, students who plagiarize when writing essays or cheat on exams have an unfair advantage over other students. For instance,it would be extremely unjust for a student who cheats on an exam to obtain a perfect score of 100, while a bright and hard-working student studies for a week to receive a score of 95.Secondly, plagiarism and cheating on tests are not only unfair to students who do their own work, but are also  $\color{green}{\text{detrimental}}$  to a university’s reputation and the worth of its  $\color{green}{\text{diploma}}$ .

<p>According to the above bar chart, the percentages of graduates’ whereabouts in a certainuniversity underwent an enormous change from 2013 to 2018. During this period, the number of students seeking employment has declined sharply from 68.1% to 60.7%,  $\color{green}{\text{whereas}}$  those choosing further education and running their own business increased markedly from 26.3% and 1.3% to 34% and 2.6% respectively.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the tendency in the bar chart above can be traced back tothree major contributors.First and foremost, with social competition becoming keener,the situation of the job market is increasingly grim. In addition, in today’s world, wherethe college population grows rapidly, further education becomes essential if they wish tocompete for a rewarding job. Last but not least, for those with a manageable schedule,exploratory frame of mind and  $\color{green}{\text{entrepreneurial}}$  spirit,starting their own business can offer important career benefits-not to mention a  $\color{green}{\text{handsome}}$   $\color{green}{\text{paycheck}}$ .</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when it comes time for university graduates to decide their nextstep in life, there is no right or wrong choice for everyone.Rather, each student must reachhis or her own conclusion. By taking career goals, financial status and personal preferencesinto consideration, students can improve their chances of making an optimal choicc</p>

<p>The table clearly reflects the statistics of staff’s job satisfaction in a certain company.According to the data given above, we can conclude that the percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is highest among those over 50 years old, at about 40%.In contrast, the percentage of the staff not satisfied with their jobs is about 64% among those in their forties,the highest among all the three age groups.</p>
<p>The major  $\color{green}{\text{determinant}}$  of satisfaction lies in people’s attitudes. On the one hand, staff members in their forties usually have to  $\color{green}{\text{undertake}}$  a lot of responsibilities from both their families and their careers. Sometimes they are even under pressure to pursue money,power, high social status, and so on, which are all symbols of success. So, they have the least satisfaction in their jobs. On the other hand, people over 50 generally have  $\color{green}{\text{shifted}}$  their life goals from achieving the ultimate success to a relatively easy and comfortable life, and therefore are  $\color{green}{\text{inclined}}$  to be much more satisfied with their jobs.</p>
<p>In view of the above reasoning, I am convinced that it is difficult for everyone to be content with their jobs. And it is advisable that people should adjust their expectations for work,and that companies should pay more attention to the welfare of their staff.</p>

The pie chart above clearly reveals the factors of consumers' concern on choosing restaurants in a certain city in 2017.Among all the five categories, the percentages of feature,  $\color{green}{\text{service}}$  and environment are the highest, accounting for 36.3%,26.8% and 23.8% respectively.  $\color{green}{\text{On the contrary}}$ , the statistics of price and other factors take up merely 8.4%and 4.7%  $\color{green}{\text{respectively}}$ , the lowest among the five groups.

Several primary causes that contribute to the above-mentioned phenomenon could be summarized as follows. In the first place, with the prosperity of economy in China andthe increase of people's income in recent decades, a large number of people are payingmore attention to the features of a restaurant instead of prices. In the second place,  $\color{green}{\text{in a bid to}}$  develop interpersonal relationship and enjoy comfortable life, consumers in mounting numbers  $\color{green}{\text{prefer}}$  service and environment to other factors.

<p>The line chart above illustrates clearly the amount of gymnasiums and people doing exercises in a certain city between 2014 and 2016.As is revealed in the graph, the statistics of people doing exercises has been  $\color{green}{\text{on a steady rise}}$ , from one million to nearly two million, whilethe number of gyms has increased considerably from 600 to about 860, a rise of about 260.</p>
<p>Several factors could contribute to this  $\color{green}{\text{tendency}}$ . In the first place, with the quickening pace and ever-increasing pressure of urban life, people in growing numbersare suffering either physical or mental problems.Thus, gymnasiums in mounting numbershave been built by concerned departments. In the second place, the desire for health isuniversal. Accordingly, people variously choose jogging, playing basketball, swimming,skating,climbing or riding as their regular exercise because exercise  $\color{green}{\text{never fails to}}$  make them stronger and more energetic.</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, I have a peculiar interest in yoga as a form of exercise.Anhour’s exercise every day usually makes me feel healthier and more vigorous.Besides, I nevertouch cigarettes or wine, nor do I stay up late. Instead, I keep a balanced diet and go to bedbefore 11 o’clock at night, because I believe burning the midnight oil is harmful to health.More importantly, an optimistic attitude toward life makes me confident and persistent.To sum up, all these practices guarantee a healthy body and a happy life.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the mixed chart above, the population over 60 years old in Chinahas increased markedly from 2000 and will continue to grow in the coming decades.From the statistics given in the diagram, we can estimate that there were 120 million aged people in 2000, accounting for about 10% of the total population, while the number will shoot up to 450 million in 2050, approximately 35% of the total.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the government,society and the children of the old should allcare for the old together. Only one or two parties’ involvement will not be enough. How wellwe handle this social issue reflects the degree of civilization of our country. To begin with, all citizens with income pay taxes to the government, so the authority is obliged to ensure astable and happy life for its people. In addition,society, including companies, associationsand organizations, should play a positive role in helping the aged people, both financially and spiritually. Last but not least, the children of the elderly should be responsible for theirparents, because their parents have not only brought them into the world, but also raised them tobe useful citizens.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I suggest that the entire society should create an environmentconducive to the happy life of the elderly. No one can escape the obligation.</p>
